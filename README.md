# ftpbackup
Light backup utility to ftp server

# Why did I do it ?
Several hosting services gives you space on an ftp server for free.
You can use off the shelf utilities, but I did not want to do something complicated.

# What does it do ?
Backup filesystems, databases (mysql, pgsql) in form of datestamped tgz files.
It's in bash

Feel free to fork/merge request :)

# TODO
- Finish test routine
- Rationalize code
- Add databases types
